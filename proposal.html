        <section>
            <h4>General Overivew</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>
                        <p>
                            How does music taste change during the time of day, during the week, or even during the month? (over time if possible) 
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            How does music taste influence mood over time? Or, vice versa? (Mood is something with a lot of dependent variables, 
                        so this isn’t necessarily the primary cause)
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            IN SHORT: Music taste vs. time, music taste vs. mood, and music vs. person
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Information Technology Problem Space</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There is a lack of long term analysis of music taste over time, and using a
                            web-app these relationships can be revealed in an interactive and easy to 
                            understand way, ultimately reducing time spent trying to find the right music.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            There have been many studies of music and mood, which we will need to study more. 
                            However, data is still very vague and will need more research. We are hoping to
                            shine more light into how music in general can affect you as a person.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>    
            <div></div>
            <h4>Existing Solutions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href= "https://medium.com/@mohithsubbarao/moodtape-using-
                        spotify-api-to-create-mood-generated-playlists-6e1244c70892"> Moodtape</a>
                        : takes input from the user, and generates a playlist around their ‘mood’.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://obscurifymusic.com/login"> Obscurify</a> 
                        : explores a user's top artists from all time or the last 6 weeks, and 
                        gives  a ranking of that user's taste. 
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Both of these don’t address the question we have in mind, about how mood and taste interact over a smaller time 
                            interval-- i.e during the day or week.
