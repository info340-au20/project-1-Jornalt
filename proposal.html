    <h1> Web-App Project 1 Proposal</h1>
    <section>
        <h3>Problem & Data Domain</h3>
        <section>
            <h4>Questions of Interest</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        How does music taste change during the time of day, during the week, or even during the month? (over time if possible) 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How does music taste influence mood over time? Or, vice versa? (Mood is something with a lot of dependent variables, 
                        so this isn’t necessarily the primary cause)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        IN SHORT: Music taste vs. time, music taste vs. mood, and music vs. person
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <h4>Information Technology Problem Space</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        There is a lack of long term analysis of music taste over time, and using a
                        web-app these relationships can be revealed in an interactive and easy to 
                        understand way, ultimately reducing time spent trying to find the right music.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There have been many studies of music and mood, which we will need to study more. 
                        However, data is still very vague and will need more research. We are hoping to
                        shine more light into how music in general can affect you as a person.

            <h4>Existing Solutions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href= "https://medium.com/@mohithsubbarao/moodtape-using-
                        spotify-api-to-create-mood-generated-playlists-6e1244c70892"> Moodtape</a>
                        : takes input from the user, and generates a playlist around their ‘mood’.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="https://obscurifymusic.com/login"> Obscurify</a> 
                        : explores a user's top artists from all time or the last 6 weeks, and 
                        gives  a ranking of that user's taste. 
                        
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both of these don’t address the question we have in mind, about how mood and taste interact over a smaller time 
                        interval-- i.e during the day or week.

        <h3>App description & Features</h3>
        <h4>Target Users</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Everyone who uses spotify. The more frequently active a user is, the more use they will get out of this. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Information Displayed</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href = https://developer.spotify.com/discover/> Spotify API info</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The users will be viewing a summary of their listening preferences from the past day, week, or month. 
                    This will be using two endpoints that spotify provide:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Mood: Danceability, Valence, Energy, Tempo
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Read user’s top tracks and artists
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Read user’s recently played tracks (up to 50)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Save and unsave tracks and albums
                        </li>
                    </ul>    
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h4>What are two forms of Interaction within the web-app?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Curating a better and more specific playlist that conforms to a users preference at a 
                    specific time of day/week    
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being able to check past listening history and assigning them to a certain mood, 
                    or better understand how the two interact to improve their lives.
                </li>
            </ul>    
        <h4>How does this web-app help solve the chosen problem?</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This app will help users better understand how their mood is 
                    affected by their current music taste, and vice versa. Through
                        providing insights on the time of day that they listen to certain 
                        music (for example, Lady Gaga in the morning and Starcadian 
                        at night), users can change their listening habits to better 
                        compliment their mood, or general preference
                </li>
